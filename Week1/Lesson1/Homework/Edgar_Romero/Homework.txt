> On our first day of class we learned about the command line (Terminal), Git, GitHub, and commands for using Git. 

> We also discused folder structure using terminal. 
	1. Understanding folder structure by creating, removing, accessing, and removing directories and files.
	2. We use commands like mkdir, rmdir, cd, pwd, ls, touch, etc. 

> The difference bewtween Front-End Development and Back-End Development.
	1. Front-End works more with the text, styling, and interactivity of the website. Basically what we see on the webpage. We use HTML, CSS, and JS to make these functions work.  
	2. Back-End focuses on 'behind the scenes' functions that make our application work. We use server side code such as Python, Ruby, C#, PHP and others to make the magic happen.

> Git is a source control management tool used by many developers to colloborate on projects where they can make changes in a structured manner. 
	1.  We use commands in git in order for developers to execute their work. 
	2. init, add, commit -m, push, pull, etc. 

> GitHub is a service that developers use to host Git repo's in the cloud. 
	1. GitHub allows developers to distribute their code by sharing their repositories. 
	2. It allows us to view code online. 

> GitHub 'Forks'
	1. Forking allows us to make a copy of someone else's project. It acts as a bridge between the original repo and our personal copy. 
	2. We can submit Pull request to make changes to other people's code. 
	3. We can clone the project onto our desktop. 
	4. We commit our changes.
	5. Push them to our repository.


## 2. Counting things

You've been given a list of the names of politicians and celebrities. You need to count how many celebrities are in the list while skipping over politicians. Using computational thinking, list the steps needed to iterate over each item in the list and increment a counter when the current name on the list is a celebrity.

couting how many celebrities are on the list 

Create name list var= celebrities 
Celebrities= 'Kim Kardashian', 'Hulk Hogan', 'Kermit the Frog', 'Matt Lauer'
Create name list var= politicans
Politician= 'Donald Trump', 'Barack Obama', 'Hilary Clinton' 
Running_total is 0 
If 'is_celebrity?' is true then running_total +1

Assumptions and tips:

- Let's assume there's a function called `is_celebrity?` that will return `true` or `false` based on whether the name you give it is that of a celebrity
- The list of names are: `['Kim Kardashian', 'Hulk Hogan', 'Kermit the Frog', 'Donald Trump', 'Matt Lauer', 'Barack Obama', 'Hillary Clinton']`
