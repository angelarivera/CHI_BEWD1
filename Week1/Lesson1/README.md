This week we covered command line basics, the basics of Git, and GitHub.

Code samples can be found in the Examples folder.

## Homework

Write about what you learned today in class. It would help me if you listed out what you learned that you didn't know before and what we covered that you already had experience with and maybe didn't need to spend so much time on.

Please submit homework by adding a folder named after yourself to the Homework folder for this lesson and then add your homework files in that folder. When complete, commit and push your changes then submit a pull request so I can pull in your changes for review.
