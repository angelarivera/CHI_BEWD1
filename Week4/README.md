# Welcome to Week 4

> This is the halfway point of the class! If you've fallen behind there's only 2 lesson's left to catch up!

## Homework

Here is the homework assigned up until this point. As you know you can find the assignments
for each week in that Week/Lesson's folder. Each week's README also has additional details. Be
sure not to overwrite files I add to this repository. I've lost one README so far but luckily it
was for a lesson where there wasn't an assignment.

All homework is due 1 week after it was assigned. I give feedback on homework every
Sunday (for Thursday classes) and Monday (for Tuesday classes) night.
