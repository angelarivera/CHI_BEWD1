# Back End Web Development (Chicago)

> Resources for the current Part Time Backend Web Dev course in Chicago

Welcome to the course! This repository will be where you, as students, and me, as an instructor, help each other through the course. Every Git repository is a living, changing thing and this one is no different. We'll likely make changes to our workflow as we work our way through the course based on what's best for all of us.

## What to expect

In this repository you'll find:

- The current and previous week's lesson slides
- Code samples for each week
- Assignments
- Any additional resources that may be helpful as you progress through the course

You should expect to find the current week's lesson added as a new folder to this repository before each class. Additional material may be added afterward based on how each class goes.

## Submitting Assignments

*Note: We'll cover this on the first day of class but if you want to get a head start, here's the deal...*

Each week's lesson folder will have a corresponding `Homework` folder. We'll all have a copy of this repository and permission to push to it and submit pull requests. So you'll add a folder with the first initial of your first name, an underscore, and your last name and then add your homework to the folder like this: if your name were John Smith the folder would be `j_smith`.

Homework will generally be due one week after it was assigned unless otherwise specified.

## Exit Tickets

Each week we ask that you fill out an Exit Ticket so we can make sure we're teaching the best class possible. You can find the link to [the very short survey here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1f3uiOqDMThtl77Vwm62KeNyBse41Ult93d0LjoyYt9A/viewform).

## Getting started

If you want to grab a copy of this repo early, follow these easy steps:

0. Create a spot on your computer where you store software projects. If you're using a Mac a good place is in the `~/Sites/` folder but you can choose anywhere you like. Open your terminal application and navigate to that directory with `cd path/to/your/projects/folder` (on some systems you can type `cd ` with a space then drag the folder into your terminal window and press `Enter`).
1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/CHI_BEWD1.git chi_bewd1 && cd $_`
2. Now you can explore the repository or open the whole thing in a text editor. If you use Sublime Text you can type `subl .` to open the folder in a new Sublime window.
3. You're done. There's not much to look at now but there will be closer to our first week.
