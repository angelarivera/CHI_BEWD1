2.1 Class notes:

what is a git repository- 

what is a git remote?
	-easy online access, non local version, colaborative space. drop box for developers but store version in the cloud
what is a git hub fork?
	-clone of the master that you are only impacting.
What does a pull request do
	-pull down from master so you can see there changes and your changes and merge them
	- data can come down from original but can't go up
what are the steps to send change from local reso to your remote on github
	-git add
	-git commit -m"messge"
	-git push origin master 
	-git bush [remote][master

Ruby review

what does 'puts' method do
	-puts stuff on the scream
two build in methods .[something] of string type?
	-length
	-capitalize 
	-upcase- caps entire string 
What are the ruby types
	-"hello"- string 
	-true-bulian
	-235-fixnum
	-3.14-float

Ruby Quiz:

def multiplier (x,y)- starts 
	result= x*y- variable to hold result, makes faster 
	if result >50
	puts "over 50"
	elsif result <50- use elsif only if more then 2 conditions
	puts 'underfift'
	else 
	puts "equal to 50"


NEW STUFF
ITERATION(ruby spesific)

3.upto(3) do |num|
	puts "#{num}. going"
end 
 .upto method justincriments by 1's
 .downto

results-
#1.going
#2.going 
#3.going 

.. what is a block?
	-everything between "do" and "end". unnamed function that runs by its self. prefaced by do
	-methods determins value of block.


Conditional Loops

count=10
while count > 0
	put "looping"
	count-=1
end

until oposit of while

loop do
	break if count <1
99.times


for this clas focus on while and each. most important loops

ITERATIOrecap- allows us to keep our code DRY(doing thing over and over again)

repeating lines of functionality.

ARRAYS-find by index
how to make
a=[]

a=Array.new

array is a ruby type unto its self
arrays are just a list of values, get it by index

ex) a=['nyc','la']
	index are a position is an arrow. index of LA is 1, ny is 0
	how to pull out by index:
	a[1]#=la
	want last idem in array a[-1]= last idem
	could also do array.last

	! band method- makes change permanent
	? bulian method- checks if true 
	a << adds thing to array OR
	a.push addings things to the end of the array
	a.unshift, adds new element to aray
	a.shift, removes first from array
	a.pop, takes out last thing in array and gives it to you
	a.uniq- return aray without duplicates
	a.uniq!- remove array with dups removed and b now have unique values
	a.join ','- converts an array into a string
		websites dont take an array, they take string- use this for convert stuff for web aps
	s.split ''- turns string into an array
	1.to_s- turns num into string
	.clear removes all elements from the array
