2.2 Class Notes 

TODAY-
	Hashes
	collections
	loops 
	API's

REVIEW
three ways to add something to an array
	.push
	<<
	.unshift
ensure unique
	.uniq
	.uniq!  = changed in place. perminent
.sort just sorts put to "persist" do ! version, sort!
.length is the fasted of .size

line 85 cataories.sort!join 

COLLECTIONS 	
hashes are simular to arrays, called dictionaries. collection of key value pairs. grab things by its key, unlike array you grab by the index. its like a 2 dimentional array

useful for holding related data
 ex) "name"=>"matt", ...... one key value pair
 	 "phone number" =>"123 456 7890"

how do you access things inside of a hash? instead of index, you use the key
ex) "student"={....}
	student['name']- student is the hash and the key is name, will return the name of the student
Setting values 
creating an empty hash-user has={}
user hash["name"]= "salman"
user has [favorite color]

SYMBOL- unique to ruby 
used as a value that isnt going to chnage. like a string except no spaces, or numbers. just a string. much cleaner then normal strings.
ex)
	:hello
	:this_is_a_symbol
	use in the context of a hash
	hash[:hello world]="hi!"     ... no quotes 
primarility used for strings in hashes

Hashes and methods 

user= {:user name => mhb email=> hbb@emial.com}

new syntaxes for =>
was	{"name"=>"angie"}
now {name: "angie"}....... much cleaner

COLLECTIONS- Array of hashes

iterating over collections
	.each
	ga_markets["NYC","LA"]
	ga_markets.each {|market| puts market}


	do is how you opena multi line block

if you want to do more complex thing in an array, use more mutlilines- 

API's

Applications Programming Interact- some sort of web service you make a request to and you get back some data. urls you make request to are called endpoints. 

json is now most common for, use to be xlm
	1)ask for data (in jason form)
	2)convert to form you can work with 
	3)manipulate data
Json- javascript object notation (kinda looks like a hash but keys and values seperated by a colin

	What is a gem? 
		a library- a colletion of functions or methods

how to do this:
	-




	check out ruby jems
		rest-client.... take arguments from a url


		to install gem throug command line 

		sudo gem install [gem name]
