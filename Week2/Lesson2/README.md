# Week 2 Lesson 2

> Hashes and APIs

This week we cover hashes but more importantly (and much more fun) we get to start working with APIs. This is the week we start making HTTP requests and working with web APIs like professional developers do day-t-day.

## Homework

### Catch up from previous weeks

Any homework from week 1 you haven't completed, please complete and send to me in a pull request. So far the homework has been:

- Create a GitHub pull request with a file in it that tells me what you learned in the first lesson
- The Quiz from week 1 lesson 2 (see the class slides)
- Teddit Conditionals - See instructions in `Week1/Lesson2/Homework/teddit_conditionals.rb`
- Secret Number - See instructions in `Week1/Lesson2/Homework/secret_number.rb`

### News API

Using the rest-client gem, request the latest stories from Mashable (http://mashable.com/stories.json) and then output each story's title, author, and content in the terminal. For better readability, output a line of dashes between each story like this: `---------------`.
