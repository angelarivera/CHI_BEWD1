The car ended up becoming stuck on the tracks, in the path of an oncoming train. \n\nSee also: What it's like to drive the Tesla Model X\n\nThe man escaped uninjured, abandoning his car before the train hit. While the car ended up being pushed about 15 metres before coming to a standstill.

It looks a lot like a road at night,\" Robert, a local resident, told the ABC. \"It's happened before.\"\n\nGPS fails are, unfortunately, all too common in Australia. In 2012, police in Mildura had to warn motorists not to rely on Apple Maps to find the small town, as several people had to be rescued after following the app into a remote national park. \n\n\"Some of the motorists located by police have been stranded for up to 24 hours without food or water and have walked long distances through dangerous terrain to get phone reception,\" Mildura police said in a statement to CNN.\n\nAlso in 2012, three Japanese tourists were forced to abandon their hire car in the waters of Moreton Bay after their GPS system instructed them to drive from the Queensland mainland to North Stradbroke Island -- definitely an island, definitely surrounded by water -- the Redland City Bulletin reported.\n\n\"It told us we could drive down there,\" Yuzu Noda said regarding the GPS. \"It kept saying it would navigate us to a road. We got stuck ... there's lots of mud.\"\n\nThe lesson in all this is, no matter what your GPS tells you, if it looks like a train track it is a train track.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

        "plain": "The LG V10 is not your typical Android smartphone. I think it's fair to call LG's V10 the world's first ultra phone.\n\nHow so? Let's start with its two screens. In addition to the 5.7-inch QuadHD display, there's a smaller secondary screen that's physically connected to it, but operates as a completely separate display that's always on 24/7. The second screen can display the date and time, notifications, app shortcuts and settings. In certain apps, the second screen can also show additional menu settings without hogging up space on the main screen.\n\nOr that the V10 has two front-facing 5-megapixel cameras for ultra-wide selfies (and no 3D depth-sensing gimmicks)? Or that it has an aluminum frame made from stainless steel and back made from Dura Skin, a silicone-like material that can absorb shock like no other device when the phone's dropped?\n\nSee also: LG's leather G4 is the swiss army knife of smartphones with a killer camera\n\nThat's not even the half of it. \n\nPowering the V10's ultra capabilities is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, 4GB of RAM and a removable 3,000 milliamp-hour battery. It's got 64GB of internal flash storage, which can be expanded to 200GB via microSD card. The V10 also has a 32-bit HiFi DAC and headphone amp for high-res audio playback. \n\nThe phone runs Android 5.1.1. Lollipop, but LG's working on updating it to Android M as soon as possible.\n\nOn the back is a 16-megapixel camera with a laser autofocus sensor -- the same camera from the LG G4 -- and f/1.8 aperture for spectacular low-light shots.\n\nThen there's the camera's manual mode for video recording. Like the manual mode for regular photos, the manual mode for video recording lets you tweak everything from the white balance, ISO, shutter speed. But because audio is incredibly important to video, it also lets you monitor the audio levels. With three built-in microphones, you can control the direction of the sound and record clear sound thanks to the wind-noise filter.\n\nAnother cool camera feature automatically edits down long video clips into digestible 15-second ones. It does this by analyzing motion vectors to pick out the most appealing shots to compile.\n\nLG's also made sharing images and videos after you've taken them a lot easier. As soon as you snap a photo, an icon will appear next to the camera roll icon. This shows your most-used sharing app -- it can be Twitter, Facebook, email, text messaging, etc. -- so you can really share right after the shot. \n\nBelow the camera is a fingerprint sensor that's also the power button. And, of course, LG's signature rear-positioned volume buttons are present on the V10 as well.\n\nLG's new beast-of-a-phone will be available in five colors (Space Black, Luxe White, Modern Beige, Ocean Blue and Opal Blue). South Korea will get it first starting this month, followed by releases in the U.S., China and other countries in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

        "plain": "Scores of U.S. Secret Service employees improperly accessed the decade-old, unsuccessful job application of a congressman who was investigating scandals inside the agency, a new government report said Wednesday. An assistant director suggested leaking embarrassing information to retaliate against Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House oversight committee.\n\nThe actions by the employees could represent criminal violations under the U.S. Privacy Act, said the report by the Homeland Security Department's inspector general, John Roth. \"It doesn't take a lawyer explaining the nuances of the Privacy Act to know that the conduct that occurred here — by dozens of agents in every part of the agency — was wrong,\" the report said.\n\nSee also: Secret Service agents investigated after White House car crash\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson personally apologized to Chaffetz again Wednesday, the congressman told the Associated Press in an interview on Capitol Hill. Johnson did not disclose whether any employees had been punished. \"It's intimidating,\" Chaffetz said. \"It's what it was supposed to be.\"\n\nJohnson said in a statement Wednesday that \"those responsible should be held accountable\" but did not provide further details.\n\n\"I am confident that U.S. Secret Service Director Joe Clancy will take appropriate action to hold accountable those who violated any laws or the policies of this department,\" Johnson said. \"Activities like those described in the report must not, and will not, be tolerated.\"\n\nChaffetz Statement on the Unauthorized Access of Personal Information By the Secret Service via @gopoversight https://t.co/JQd57o5Gm3— Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) September 30, 2015\n\nClancy also apologized Wednesday for \"this wholly avoidable and embarrassing misconduct.\"\n\n\"I will continue to review policies and practices to address employee misconduct and demand the highest level of integrity of all our employees,\" Clancy said in a statement.\n\nEmployees accessed Chaffetz's 2003 application for a Secret Service job starting 18 minutes after the start of a congressional hearing in March about the latest scandal involving drunken behavior by senior agents. Some forwarded the information to others. At least 45 employees viewed the file.\n\nChaffetz applied to join the Secret Service through a field office and was rejected and labeled \"Better Qualified Candidate\" for unknown reasons. Chaffetz said he never interviewed with the agency and does not know why his application was declined.\n\nOne week later, Assistant Director Ed Lowery suggested leaking embarrassing information about Chaffetz in retaliation for aggressive investigations by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee into a series of agency missteps and scandals, the report said. Days later, on April 2, the information about Chaffetz unsuccessfully applying for a job at the Secret Service was published by The Daily Beast.\n\n\"Some information that he might find embarrassing needs to get out. Just to be fair,\" Lowery wrote March 31 in an email to fellow Assistant Director Faron Paramore.\n\nLowery, who is in charge of training, told the inspector general he did not direct anyone to release information about Chaffetz and \"believed it would have been inappropriate to do so,\" the report said. He told Roth the email was \"reflecting his stress and his anger.\"\n\nLowery declined to comment though a Secret Service spokesman.\n\nChaffetz told the AP that Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., would conduct any congressional oversight hearings into the matter.\n\nMaryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said anyone at the agency \"unwilling or unable to meet the highest of ethical standards should not be a part of the Secret Service.\"\n\nThe inspector general said that under U.S. law and Secret Service rules, employees were required to report such behavior to supervisors. The investigation found that 18 supervisors or members of the agency's senior executive service knew or should have known that employees had improperly accessed Chaffetz's job application, but only one person attempted to inform the Secret Service director, Joseph Clancy.\n\nSee also: Secret Service Director Resigns\n\nClancy said he was not aware of what was going on until April 1.\n\nDuring the March hearing, Clancy testified for the third time about an incident weeks earlier in which two senior agents were accused of drinking for several hours at a bar before driving a government vehicle into the White House complex, as on-duty personnel were investigating a suspicious item dropped on a roadway near the White House. It was the latest in a string of embarrassments, missteps and security breaches for the agency charged with protecting the president and his family.\n\nClancy took the helm of the agency on a temporary basis late last year after then-Director Julia Pierson was ousted following the disclosure of two security breaches, including an incident in which a man armed with a knife was able to scale a White House fence and run deep into the executive mansion.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

        "plain": "For the all-natural enthusiast, some of the popular supplements of yore just don’t cut it anymore. Luckily, as all-natural diets and lifestyles have gained popularity in recent years, so has interest in and development of natural ways to get the vitamins and nutrients you need to reach and exceed your personal fitness and wellness goals.\r\n1. Whole food multivitamins\r\nA multivitamin supplement is, of course, a staple to any health regimen, and whole food-enhanced vitamins like GNC SuperFoods Ultra Mega® Green Men’s and GNC SuperFoods Ultra Mega® Green Women’s are a great way to get the vitamins and minerals you need to maintain overall health.\r\n2. Green food supplements \r\nGreen food powder supplements are made from raw plant-based ingredients. The Amazing Grass® Green SuperFood® flavors are made from a combination of potent superfoods to help you to eat more veggies, and they also include Yerba Mate and Matcha Green Tea.\r\n3. Omega-3 supplements\r\nAccording to the University of Maryland Medical Center, omega-3s are essential fatty acids that help maintain heart, brain, joint, eye and skin health. GNC Triple Strength Fish Oil 1500 will provide you with plenty of omega-3s.\r\n4. Plant-based protein shakes\r\nPlant-based protein supplements are a great option if you’re following a vegetarian or vegan diet and want an easy way to boost your protein intake. GNC PUREDGE™ Complete Vegan Protein packs 20 grams of plant-based protein into one scoop that you can mix with water or a milk of your choice.\r\n5. Probiotics\r\nWhen you think bacteria, you probably think it’s bad. But while all bacteria is inherently natural, not all of it is bad for you. Probiotic supplements give you ample “good” bacteria that help support your immune and digestive systems.GNC Ultra 25 Probiotic Complex with Enzymes is a great and convenient choice, as it’s a probiotic that doesn’t require refrigeration.\r\n6. Sleep aids\r\nIf you’re living as close to an all-natural life as you can, you’re going to want to avoid certain sleep aids. But herbal sleep aids do exist, like the GNC Herbal Plus® Natra Sleep™ supplement, which can help.\r\n7. Lavender essential oils\r\nEssential oils are all-natural and have a ton of different benefits. Lavender oil is a particularly popular one, and a tiny 1-ounce bottle —like Now® Lavender Oil—can last you a pretty long time. It’s most often used for its calming effects, but it has myriad additional benefits. Just rub two or three drops in your palms, cup your hands, and breathe in the soothing scent.\r\n8. Herbal supplements\r\nHerbal supplements, sometimes called botanicals, aren’t new, according to the Mayo Clinic, whose staff members say plants have been used for medicinal purposes for thousands of years. The GNC Herbal Plus® supplement line offers herbs to provide all kinds of health and wellness benefits, from milk thistle’s liver health support, to gingko biloba’s support of mental sharpness and memory."

        "plain": "When your schedule is frequently packed with work, family and social obligations, fitness and healthy eating habits can be tough to maintain — and they often fall to the wayside.\n\nBut it doesn’t have to be that way. These days, there are plenty of items you can carry with you through your hectic day to ensure you’re getting what you need to meet your fitness goals, and getting the most you can out of your workouts — regardless of when and how you’re fitting them in.\r\n1. Protein bars\r\nIf you need to fuel up on your way to a workout, or start your recovery after, protein bars are easy to carry with you, and you can consume them on the go. Nothing is easier than a protein-packed snack that you can eat while you walk. GNC’s Pro Performance® Oatmeal Protein Bar Deluxe is a delicious choice that provides protein to fuel muscle, protein and carbs for energy and a combination of fiber and protein which support satiety so you’re less likely to make an unhealthy choice, no matter how busy you are.\r\n2. Multivitamins\r\nA multivitamin is super easy to seamlessly fit into your routine (it takes approximately five seconds to take a pill, after all), and it’ll help you get the combination of basic vitamins and nutrients you need to support optimal health. Try a formula from the GNC Women’s Mega® or GNC® Mega Men collections. There are several varieties of each to fit your individual needs, age and health goals.\r\n3. Energy supplements\r\nThe busier you are, the more energy you need — especially if you combine a busy life with physical exercise and exertion. Keep some ZOOM® Energy Chews on your person and pop one when you need an energy boost.\r\n4. Creatine\r\nWhen you’re fitting in exercise wherever you can, creatine can be a valuable supplemental tool. It helps your boost muscle energy, so you can get the most out of a workout even if you’re fitting it into a short period of time. And GNC Pro Performance® Amplified Creatine 189™ is more than just any creatine — it’s proven to get into your muscles and improve strength more efficiently than “normal” creatine.\r\n5. Amino acids\r\nAmino acids are an important component to recovery, so consider adding a supplement like GNC GenetixHD™ Metabolic BCAA™ to your post-workout ritual.\r\n6. Omega-3 supplements\r\nAccording to the University of Maryland Medical Center, omega-3s are essential fatty acids that help support heart, brain, joint, eye and skin health.  The easiest way to get ample omega-3s is through a capsule like the GNC Triple Strength Fish Oil 1500.\r\n7. Hydrating beverages\r\nHydration is always important, but even more so when you’re exercising regularly. You’ll want to drink plenty of water throughout the day, but after your workout, reload on electrolytes with a bottle of  AQUAhydrate™. The electrolytes will help you hydrate without the added sugar and calories found in sports drinks. You can even mix it into your post-workout protein shake!"

        "plain": "If a single word could encapsulate the digital revolution of the past decade, that word would be \"disruption.\" \n\nThe rise of the Internet and advanced technologies has allowed businesses and individuals to completely rethink the ways we live, and then cast aside or reinvent the practices that no longer make sense.  Disruption is the reason we now order taxis on our phones, shop online instead of in brick and mortar stores and why billion-dollar enterprises can be upended by a startup in someone's garage. \n\nWith all of this disruption going around, intrepid tech users are constantly on the lookout for the next innovations that can cure everyday annoyances. And the latest bulls-eye rests squarely on the workplace. \n\nThink about it: Why do offices even exist?\n\nThe answer -- until recently -- was that companies needed a defined space where employees could focus, communicate and work together to solve problems. Of course, we also can't forget about the massive stores of vital information -- cabinets and rooms filled to the brim with files -- that could only be accessed in person. \n\nIn today’s connected world, though, the purpose of an office still exists, but when it comes to facilitating business the role of a physical space is becoming more flexible. For the first time in corporate history, remote employees can use cloud infrastructure and high-speed Internet to be just as present as those on site. \n\nSuddenly, the time and cost of commuting can be slashed.\n\nAnd be honest: Wouldn’t it be great to choose to visit the office only when you needed to?\n\nThe global workforce is already making its choice heard. According to 2014 workforce statistics, 20% of employees across the world already telecommute. And that same research found that 64% of workers would accept lower pay in exchange for the ability to work from home. \n\nThat said, \"a couch near you\" is hardly the office of the future. For all of its faults, the traditional office setting has a few things going for it: From business benefits like the ability to efficiently participate in group work, to person benefits, like staving off feelings of loneliness and alienation.\n\nPlus, to risk being old-fashioned, there's something to be said for spontaneous, \"water cooler\" collaboration that happens outside of formal meeting environments. In fact, many remote workers admit that their new style of work is only good to a point -- they still need human, face-to-face relationships to perform at their peak.\n\nModern offices need to meet in the middle of the traditional and remote workplaces. The office of the future needs to cultivate an environment where people want to be and use design to create spaces where people can work together and be happy, productive and profitable. \n\n\"I'm not sure the office of the future is an office\"\n\nThe workplace as we know it is at a crossroads. Companies need to find a way to reconcile employee desire to be remote with the need for the collaborative environment that a traditional office provides. \n\nAn interesting take on this delicate problem is developing inside a network of co-working spaces called Impact Hubs. With 73 locations in 49 countries around the globe, Impact Hubs are open, shared spaces that enable entrepreneurs and small business owners to assemble small, hyper-localized teams for in-person problem solving and collaboration. \n\nImpact Hubs are artful blends of remote working and organized workspaces. Granted, the purpose of the Impact Hub network is to unite companies with a social agenda, you can imagine how the concept could be extrapolated out in the context of a large corporation -- like having company-owned coffee shops in every county. \n\nIn the words of Richard Evans, director of Impact Hub, \"I'm not sure the office of the future is an office.\" Instead, Evans points to his modern, multi-functional spaces, which blends meeting rooms, social space and independent workspaces as a possible alternative. The geographically diverse branches are also assets to Evans' idea. As one Impact Hub tenant says, \"the future of business is to be local everywhere.\"\n\nThanks to technology, evolved workspaces like Impact Hubs are now possible, making it easier than ever to change a part of our lives that desperately needed disruption. The office of the future is just another notch in the belt of the digital age.\n\nWant to see what the office of the future looks like today?\n\nThe Impact Hub concept is just the tip of the iceberg. The dynamic of the office changes every day, even if those changes take less-drastic forms than a completely remote workforce. \n\nTo find out more about how the office is evolving as the way we work changes -- and to find out how to make sure your business keep up -- check out the Office of the Future series on HP BusinessNow."

        "plain": "These days, we tend to hear a lot about the ways in which technology is transforming small businesses, making it easier than ever for clever entrepreneurs to live out their wildest dreams. But at the same time, it seems like those conversations are often reserved for more \"traditional\" start-up types. \n\nWell, a handful of global businesswomen are out to prove that you don't have to be a Silicon Valley hopeful to see the real benefits of technology. \n\nThese women – one clothing designer, one baker and two roadside storeowners – were given a unique opportunity to partner with local business advocates and the Qualcomm Wireless Reach initiative in an effort to accelerate their businesses through mobile technology.\n\nWatch the videos below to see how a simple change can make a world of a difference and turn dreams into reality. \n\n---\n\nThe first rule of business is simple: Create a product or service and sell it to someone with money. \n\nIn the Philippines, sari-sari storeowners know that rule well. The Philippine equivalent of an American convenience store, a sari-sari store is a rural, one-stop-shop where community members can buy a wide array of goods and food products. And like any business, the best sari-sari stores have exactly what customers are looking for.\n\nHowever, in the wake of a destructive typhoon in 2013, there was one thing that community members yearned for, yet sari-saris couldn't deliver. \n\nA large amount of Filipino communities don't have access to traditional banking systems, which means they're forced to rely on less conventional methods for managing their finances and paying bills. Small \"money hubs\" are the most popular of the non-traditional solutions, effectively taking the place of a bank without the strings attached. These hubs can crop up anywhere, but sari-sari stories have increasingly offered the financial service as a part of their business repertoire. \n\nIn order to stay competitive, Nanay Bella and Nanay Alicia partnered with Hapinoy – a social enterprise that specializes in educating, training, and equipping sari-sari owners with mobile money hub capabilities– and Qualcomm Wireless Reach to turn their sari-sari stores into mobile money hubs that can help better serve the needs of communities, and provide a much-needed avenue for business growth.\n\nReflecting on her initial reluctance to change her business, Alicia now claims she is able to advise community members to embrace technology. \"I tell them to keep an open mind because you never know when new opportunities to grow your business, like mobile technology, will come your way,\" she says. \n\nBella is equally grateful, describing how the money hub business helped resurrect her sari-sari store after the devastation of the typhoon, and how now, she enjoys entrepreneurship even more. \"My business allows my everyday life to make sense and have more meaning,\" she says. \n\n---\n\nStriking out on your own is hard. But finding the next level of growth for your new business can be even harder – and more crucial to your success. \n\nFor many successful small businesses, taking advantage of available technologies is a critical part of achieving that next level of growth, which is why Putri Hamzah of Hatasia Curvy and Haziqah Zuhuri of Scrummy Cake Design turned to the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women’s  Mentoring Women in Business program in Malaysia. \n\nThe mentoring program is a support system for its members, giving them a network to find tips on all facets of running a business, from marketing to accounting to creating a business plan. But in addition to merely being a resource to budding entrepreneurs, the program also supplies each member a 3G-enabled tablet so they can put new digital strategies into action anytime, anywhere. \n\nHamzah says she uses the tablet to connect with her personal mentor twice a week, and also watches \"How to\" videos that help her keep designs fresh and exciting. \n\nZuhuri, on the other hand, has used her newfound connectivity to take her business into the world of social media, concentrating heavily on her brand's presence on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. \n\nThanks to the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women’s and Qualcomm Wireless Reach, both women are able to learn how to harness the power of the Internet and use technology to drive the growth of their businesses. \n\n---\n\nA connected business is a successful business. And although it’s a concept that many take for granted, the power of technology is transforming small businesses all over the world. \n\nThe Qualcomm Wireless Reach initiative is committed to partnering with NGO’s, social enterprises and local organizations to bring advanced wireless technology and connectivity to the small business owners who need it the most. If you're interested in learning more about the initiative, or would like to sponsor or mentor a budding entrepreneur, tweet @QCWirelessReach."

        "plain": "Russia-linked hackers tried at least five times to pry into Hillary Clinton's private email account while she was secretary of state, emails released Wednesday show. It is unclear if she clicked on any attachment and exposed her account.\n\nClinton received the infected emails, disguised as speeding tickets, over four hours early on the morning of Aug. 3, 2011. The emails instructed recipients to print the attached tickets, which would have allowed hackers to take control of their computers.\n\nSee also: Hillary Clinton calls her private email server a 'mistake,' apologizes\n\nSecurity researchers who analyzed the malicious software in September 2011 said that infected computers would transmit information from victims to at least three server computers overseas, including one in Russia. That doesn't necessarily mean Russian intelligence or citizens were responsible.\n\nClinton has said repeatedly that the unusual homebrew server she used was secure. When apologizing for the \"mistake\" of using the personal email server for work-related emails, she reiterated that the usage of the personal server was still \"allowed\" and \"above board.\"\n\nBut the phishing attempts highlight the risk of Clinton's unsecure email being pried open by foreign intelligence agencies, even if others also received the virus concealed as a speeding ticket from Chatham, New York. The email misspelled the name of the city, came from a supposed New York City government account and contained a \"Ticket.zip\" file that would have been a red flag.\n\nMost commercial antivirus software at the time would have detected the software, identified it as dangerous and prevented users from infecting themselves. It was unclear if the State Department's network security would have flagged the infected message, or what precautions were in place protecting Clinton's server in the basement of her home in Chappaqua.\n\nThe new revelation only deepens the controversy surrounding Clinton's email server. It was recently revealed that the server had not been properly \"wiped\" meaning previously deleted emails may be recoverable. \n\nAnd just last week a chain of work-related emails that Clinton failed to turn over to the State Department was discovered by the Obama Administration. \n\nAdditional reporting by Mashable.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

        "plain": "BURBANK, California -- In any other scenario, the scene taking place would be a grave emergency: There are three gurneys lined up, each with a patient surrounded by IV stands and connected to wires. \n\nThere's a man, a pregnant woman, and a slightly portly gentleman whose hairy legs are sticking out from underneath a blue surgical towel that's covering his pelvic area. \n\nSee also: How 'NCIS' became the world's most-watched show\n\nThese patients are made of plastic, but on this July day, they're very real to the cast of CBS's Code Black. It's training day for the actors, who in just a few of these medical boot camp sessions need to learn how to become doctors. \n\nWell, how to look like one, anyway. \n\nOn screen, their movements around high-octane responses to traumas must look seamless and like it's second nature. \n\nReal doctors and nurses have been brought to the set in Burbank to teach the cast. Many of them are people executive producer and medical doctor Ryan Mcgarry \"went to battle with\" back in his days in the emergency room. \n\n\"I think they're invaluable in transmitting the culture of that world in the ER and those skill sets to our actors,\" he told Mashable. \n\nAt this point, the actors are about to begin filming what will be their second episode. But they received a crash course -- where they learned how to properly wheel a gurney and other basics -- a few months back, ahead of filming the pilot. \n\nIn fact, all 75 hospital employee extras who appeared on that first episode went through it. The show recruited 30 real medical professionals to build an authentic, living, breathing emergency room. (The latter group even joined SAG so they would have the ability to talk on screen.) \n\nThis goes beyond normal protocol in these scenarios. Usually, extras are given their wardrobe and given instructions on where to walk and what to move. But the team wanted it to feel like real cases were going on at all times. \n\n\"We decided early on that the environment we wanted and the energy we wanted could only be achieved if we filled it with real people,\" said executive producer Michael Seitzman. \"And we told the extras: 'This is your patient. This is what's wrong with your patient ... treat your patient. Do what you would normally do.'\"\n\nThe actors were then told that their scene would have to fit into that chaotic situation, \"over that roar,\" as Seitzman describes it. \n\nThe grittiness they set out to accomplished is very much achieved in the first episode. It's chaotic and stressful and looks like hard work. \n\nOn this day, there's another type of work going on as the cast learns how to insert central lines and practices suturing on notecard-sized pieces of fake flesh. They listen intently and ask questions of their instructor, who, after teaching the group, will report for an evening shift in the real ER. \n\nShe offers to let them shadow at one point, if they're interested. \n\nBenjamin Hollingsworth, who plays Dr. Mario Savetti, immediately bites. \"Are you working Sunday?\" he asks her. \n\nMuch of this outside work takes place between filming, but the actors seem more than willing to put in the time and do the homework. \n\n\"Michael and I are both really impressed when, throughout the process, [the actors] would ask us why they're doing certain things,\" Mcgarry said. \"It's not enough for them to move their hands and fake a procedure, they want to know why they're doing it, and I think it makes their dialogue more connected to what they're doing.\" \n\nSometimes a little too connected. \n\nHarry Ford is visibly squeamish when the teacher describes a central line gone wrong. Thankfully, co-star William Allen Young is there to provide perspective. \n\n\"Thank goodness this is not real.\" \n\nCode Black airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. on CBS.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

        "plain": "Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin issued a last-minute stay of execution for death-row inmate Richard Glossip on Wednesday, moments before he was set to die by lethal injection.\n\nThe governor's 37-day stay comes amid protests over the planned execution and several high-profile pleas for the state to reconsider it, including a personal request from Pope Francis.\n\nSee also: Georgia executes first woman in 70 years despite Pope Francis' plea\n\nWednesday's was the third stay of execution for Glossip; previous stays were issued in January 2015 and two weeks ago, on Sept. 16, 2015.\n\nThis marks the third, yes third, time #RichardGlossip has come within hours of execution before receiving a stay.— Graham Lee Brewer (@grahambrewer) September 30, 2015\n\nUnexplained mix-up with lethal injection drugs\n\nGov. Fallin's stay was issued at the request of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections due to the fact that the third drug used in the lethal cocktail the state planned to use to kill Glossip was potassium acetate, and not the potassium chloride the state previously said it would employ. \n\nAccording to the state of Oklahoma's execution policy [PDF here], when the state uses the three-drug cocktail, as it planned to administer to Glossip, the drug midazolam is administered to cause unconsciousness so that the prisoner doesn't feel the more painful effects of the subsequent drugs. Next is vecuronium bromide, which paralyzes the body, and last is potassium chloride, which stops the heart. \n\nPotassium acetate is not mentioned in the state's execution policy, hence the stay. \n\nStay of execution from Oklahoma Gov. for #RichardGlossip: forhttp://www.sos.ok.gov/documents/Executive/1004.pdf pic.twitter.com/KXVJjbkPrd— Mashable News (@MashableNews) September 30, 2015\n\nWhat remains to be answered is how the wrong drug was selected. According to the Washington Post, the state is required to tell the inmate what drugs it will use 10 days prior to the execution and that Glossip's attorneys were told potassium chloride would be used. \n\nSo it seems both Glossip's attorneys and the Attorney General were only informed about the drug issues right before it was set to start.— Chris McDaniel (@csmcdaniel) September 30, 2015\n\nJUST IN: Attorney for #RichardGlossip says he received a letter from DOC prior to execution & made no mention of Potassium Acetate @NEWS9— Justin Dougherty (@DoughertyNews9) September 30, 2015\n\nAfterward, officials expressed frustration over the mix-up but little was offered by way of answers. Oklahoma Department of Corrections Director Robert Patton made a brief statement but did not answer questions afterward.\n\nOklahoma Dept of Corrections Director Robert Patton announces stay of #RichardGlossip's execution. pic.twitter.com/5oYeC9kk7o— Samantha Vicent (@samanthavicent) September 30, 2015\n\nOklahoma Attorney General @ScottPruittOK's office says they are \"frustrated\" about the drug mix up. #Glossip pic.twitter.com/0BpDIQ8CyA— Graham Lee Brewer (@grahambrewer) September 30, 2015\n\nFor now, today's events have not affected two other upcoming executions in Oklahoma. \n\nGlossip's state of mind\n\nAfter the stay was issued, Glossip spoke via phone with anti-death penalty advocate Sister Helen Prejean and then spoke to reporters via speakerphone. He expressed relief, happy for the extra time his legal team will have to focus on his case.  \"I'll take as many days as I'll get,\" he added.\n\nResponding to the news that the stay was granted over the confusion with the selected drugs, Glossip said: \"That's just crazy.\"\n\n.@helenprejean on the phone with #RichardGlossip moments after his stay of execution. pic.twitter.com/OSOsLnQDq8— Graham Lee Brewer (@grahambrewer) September 30, 2015\n\nSpeaking to KOCO after the events of the afternoon, Glossip walked reporters through his afternoon and maintained his innocence, saying he felt \"like a yo-yo.\" \n\nQuestions over lethal injection drugs\n\nFollowing a series of botched executions, including one in Ohio during which an inmate seemed to be alive even after the first drug, midazolam, was administered, three inmates, including Glossip, petitioned the United States Supreme Court to ban the use of midazolam in a case eventually named for Glossip (Glossip v Gross).\n\nThe court issued a stay for the three Oklahoma executions, including Glossip's, in January 2015 so that it could review the state's use of midazolam in its lethal drug cocktail. \n\nIn June, the court ruled in a 5-4 decision to allow the use of midazolam. In writing for the majority, Justice Alito said that the inmates who objected to its use had not offered an alternative nor had it been proven there was a risk of undue pain caused by using the drug.\n\nWho is Richard Glossip?\n\nRichard Glossip is accused of ordering Justin Sneed to murder their former boss, Barry Alan Van Treese, the owner of a Best Budget Inn that Glossip managed, because Glossip may have feared losing his job.\n\nHe was convicted after the 1997 killing of Van Treese, despite what's been described as a remarkable lack of evidence against him. Sneed, a former maintenance worker at the hotel, is serving life in prison, having avoided the death penalty by telling prosecutors Glossip had paid him to kill Van Treese.\n\nMany who have studied the case believe Glossip is innocent. His conviction was overturned in 2001 only for him to be convicted again in 2004, on largely the same evidence.\n\nArchbishop Carlo Maria Viganò wrote a letter to Gov. Fallin on behalf of Pope Francis, asking for clemency for Glossip.\n\nLetter on behalf of Pope Francis asking Ok. Gov Mary Fallin to commute Richard Glossip's death sentence. pic.twitter.com/iprFFpLCts— Tasneem N (@TasneemN) September 30, 2015\n\nHis family members gathered outside the Oklahoma State Penitentiary celebrated and embraced after news of the stay broke. \n\nWas talking to Don Knight when news of stay came. Family cried out. So much relief. And balloons. #Glossip pic.twitter.com/Dn9jfbavQV— Liliana Segura (@LilianaSegura) September 30, 2015\n\nPope Francis also made a plea for another prisoner to be spared execution earlier this week, but his request was ignored. Georgia prisoner Kelly Gissendane was executed Wednesday morning while she sang \"Amazing Grace,\" a witness reported.\n\nShe was the first female put to death in the state of Georgia since Lena Baker in 1945. The bid for clemency was denied by the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Parolees.\n\nAdditional reporting from Colin Daileda. Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments."

        "plain": "When Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards testified before Congress on Tuesday, she had to politely remind the Republicans questioning her that abortion is indeed a legal medical procedure in the United States. \n\nMany of them clearly believe it should be illegal and barely concealed their contempt for Richards, the nonprofit organization she leads and the practice of terminating a pregnancy before it is viable. \n\nSee also: Congressmen mansplain women's health issues to Planned Parenthood president\n\nRichards' opponents draw passionate conviction from having watched highly-edited, \"undercover\" videos of Planned Parenthood officials talking about legal fetal tissue research donation programs, and have charged the organization with \"trafficking\" in the sales of body parts belonging to unborn children. \n\nThese claims are unproven; several states launched their own investigations of local affiliates and found no evidence of wrongdoing. \n\n\"I don’t really believe that an organization, a healthcare provider, should be discriminated against for providing a legal service,\"  Richards said. \n\nThe accusations based on these videos, however, have all but destroyed our ability to talk about abortion with any measure of civility. The hearing, held by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, became an hours-long — five to be exact — exercise in trying to embarrass Richards and corner her into admitting that she and Planned Parenthood have committed acts of \"infanticide\" and \"barbarity.\" \n\n\"We can carve up a child and call it a choice,\" said Oklahoma Representative Steve Russell. \"We can destroy human life and call it health care; we can make the killing of children legal and pretend it is beneficial; we can cover acts of barbarity with a veneer of civility; but we cannot escape our accountability before the creator of life.” \n\n(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3\";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));Today, I questioned the President of Planned Parenthood. Hear my closing remarks -->Posted by Congressman Steve Russell on Tuesday, September 29, 2015\n\nWhile the hearing's political theater reflected the deeply held beliefs of some Congressmen and women, it did not make for effective public policy.\n\nRussell, along with several of his colleagues, concluded that Planned Parenthood does not need $528 million in annual government funding, which it mostly receives in the form of Medicaid and Title IX reimbursements to subsidize health care for low-income women and men. \n\nThey harangued Richards about her half-million dollar salary and travel expenses. They pointed to their own private sector experience managing overhead and revenue to argue that Planned Parenthood uses government funding poorly. \n\nWith high salaries ($2.47m for the president since 2009) and profits ($1.3b in 2014), does #PlannedParenthood really need our tax dollars?— Rep. Mark Walker (@RepMarkWalker) September 29, 2015\n\nThey argued that the shuttering of Planned Parenthood clinics around the country wouldn't affect a woman's ability to receive health care, even though a recent report [PDF] from the Congressional Budget Office found that eliminating federal funding for the organization could reduce access to care for as many as 25% of its patients. The fact that many public and nonprofit health clinics are overwhelmed with patients and private providers are often loathe to take Medicaid patients did not matter. \n\nThere seems to be no reasoning with the politicians intent on defunding Planned Parenthood. In their minds, there is simply no justification for allowing the organization, which provides 2.7 million men and women with essential health care every year, to receive government funding for services like cancer screening, birth control and annual check-ups. \n\nPlanned Parenthood provides necessary healthcare services for millions of women every year. #PinkOut #StandwithPP pic.twitter.com/dTOlSjvDS0— Sen. Tammy Baldwin (@SenatorBaldwin) September 29, 2015\n\nRichards seemed baffled at times by the single-mindedness of her interlocutors. Her appeals to a shared interest in providing women life-saving care was characterized as disingenuous. When Richards said that 25% of Texas women lost access to reproductive health services after the passage of restrictive anti-abortion laws, she was ignored. \n\nWisconsin Rep. Glenn Grothman kept proposing a hypothetical scenario in which Planned Parenthood clinics in midsize cities closed with little consequence. \n\n\"In my opinion, if Planned Parenthood disappeared tomorrow in those towns, there would still be three or four or five clinics or hospitals providing all the medical care you would want,\" he said. \n\nIf a hypothetical question a congressman answers himself is now the standard for ensuring that women can prevent pregnancy and detect cancer, because the fury of the abortion debate has eclipsed our political will for compromise, we should all be worried about what comes next. \n\nCommittee chairman Jason Chaffetz said it certainly won't be the end of the House's investigation. And with no real way forward — no possibility that Republicans will acknowledge the vital role that Planned Parenthood plays in the American healthcare system — the debate is only likely to become coarser and more divided. \n\nPeter Welch, a Democrat from Vermont, perhaps said it best: \"We're having an argument that's never going to end about abortion, but we’re proposing to proceed in a way in where the effect of our quote investigation is going to have collateral consequences that compromise the ability of women to get access to basic health care needs.\" \n\nIt's now up to the American voters to demand their elected officials find a new way to talk about abortion -- one that respects a woman's legal and constitutional right to have one. \n\nHave something to add to this story?

        "plain": "Though photographer Sam Yeldham deals mostly in gorgeous shots of Sydney sunsets, a coincidence this past weekend led to his first wedding photo of a mystery couple. \n\nYeldham tells Mashable that he spotted the couple while shooting a time-lapse of a storm rolling over Bradley's Head in Sydney harbor. The newlyweds and their wedding photographer were debating whether or not to shoot a few photos in the rain. Yeldham's girlfriend even offered to hold an umbrella above the photographer while she shot.\n\nSee also: Bride and groom (and 250 guests) shoot a baller wedding music video\n\nWhen the weather momentarily cleared, the couple walked out onto the pier, and Yeldham captured his first wedding shot. The couple left before he could learn their names and exchange information.\n\nTo find his subjects, he turned to his personal Instagram, which doubles as a digital portfolio for his work. Within three days, he'd made contact.\n\n\"I didn't expect to find the couple so quickly,\" he said. \"I thought I would be ringing around wedding venues and florists for a week but the Internet just worked so fast. It was quite amazing really.\"\n\nThe newlyweds in question go by Jess and Chris, Buzzfeed reports. Liv Style Photography shared this image of the couple standing on Bradley's Head.\n\n    Incredible scenes from Jess and Chris wedding on the weekend!

The couple were really happy with the photograph; they are currently on their honeymoon in Hawaii, so I think it was a pretty crazy/special thing to happen.\"\n\nHave something to add to this story?

        "plain": "This article is part of DBA, a series on Mashable about running a business that features insights from leaders in entrepreneurship, venture capital and management.\n\nWhen you join an established company as CEO, you face an opportunity to not only architect the organization's next phase, but also to shape the next chapter of your life. A new CEO's first year is a crucial transition period -- it's a time to listen, learn, build relationships and seek counsel. \n\nLast year, the first thing I did after joining a 10-year-old company as CEO was to hold one-on-one meetings with every employee. I listened, learned and built relationships. Armed with a wealth of understanding from the more than 100 conversations, I then sought advice from my most trusted advisors. \n\nSee also: 5 strategies for running a company in a hyper-growth stage\n\nHere are five pieces of advice I heeded that helped make my transition a successful one.\n\n1. Get to know the people who run the business\n\nAs a new CEO, you inherit a team that you didn't have a hand in shaping, but you'll nevertheless work closely with. It's crucial that you spend time prioritizing people. Start by understanding those closest to the business. \n\nSpeak with founders, investors, board members and of course, the current leadership. Investigate how they work, what matters to them and to their employees and how they describe their vision. Ask about what they think they can improve and how you can best contribute. Share your own background — including what drives you personally and professionally — to build a foundation of trust.\n\n2. Understand the business itself\n\nAfter you meet with leadership and understand the company structure, prioritize understanding the business. Learn the ins and outs of the market opportunity, your customer base and the product roadmap. Ask the current leadership what they have planned for the next 18 months and why they've made those plans.\n\nLook at the timeline leading up to this precise stage in the business. Take time to understand what's happened thus far and what's planned for the future before shaking things up. Once you deeply understand the company and its opportunity, you can identify areas to build new functions and recruit the team members to lead them. \n\n3. Respect the company's history\n\nAs you make changes to the business, be thoughtful about communicating change within the company's existing context. Understand the heritage, culture and foundation, so you can better articulate how proposed changes will complement the company's future. \n\nOnce you're aligned at a high level — with the founders, board and leadership team — educate everyone across the company about why you're making changes, how they fit into the company's DNA and how they'll lead to future success. \n\n4. Make yourself available\n\nDon't just say you have an open door policy; live it. Prioritize spending a lot of time with employees in person, no matter where they're located. While this can be a significant operational challenge, there's no substitute for face-time. \n\nVisit different offices — even if they're halfway around the world — and meet with employees. Open up your calendar and find opportunities to get to know people outside the office. Don't just explain what you're doing; ask for different viewpoints and ask how you can help make their jobs easier and more fulfilling. \n\n5. Remember: It's impossible to over-communicate\n\nRelentless, ongoing conversation is incredibly important for sustaining relationships, building trust and maintaining alignment. Just when you think you've communicated enough, there's always a benefit in communicating more. \n\nIn addition to sharing regular updates (through all-hands meetings, email newsletters and so on), you should encourage everyone to ask questions when they come up. Consider using a framework to help everyone understand the company's priorities and objectives, and reinforce why your decisions align with the overall vision and values.\n\nYour first year as CEO is a time of transition for you and for the company. Prioritize educating yourself, building relationships and communicating change as openly and empathetically as possible. If you spend your first 12 months investing in this foundation, you'll position the company for better alignment in the future. That will help everyone across the company write its next chapter together."

        "plain": "The U.S. Government remains open for business — for the time being.\n\nJust hours before a midnight deadline, a bitterly divided Congress approved a stopgap spending bill Wednesday to keep the federal government open — but with no assurance there won't be yet another shutdown showdown in December.\n\nSee also: Congress proves it's now impossible to talk sanely about abortion\n\nDemocrats helped beleaguered House Republican leaders pass the measure by 277-151 — a lopsided vote shrouding deep disagreements within the GOP — after the Senate approved it by a 78-20 tally earlier in the day. The votes sent the bill to President Barack Obama for his signature, but not without White House carping.\n\n\"The American people deserve far better than last-minute, short-term legislating,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in pressing for a broader, longer-lasting budget deal.\n\nApproval of such stopgap measures used to be routine, but debate this year exposed acrimonious divisions between pragmatic Republicans such as House Speaker John Boehner and more junior lawmakers in the party's tea party wing who are less inclined to compromise. The tea partyers had demanded that the must-pass measure be used to punish Planned Parenthood, stripping it of federal money because of its practice of supplying tissue from aborted fetuses for scientific research.\n\nHouse Republicans opposed the measure by a clear margin, but Democratic support was unanimous.\n\n\"Congress should pass a budget that reverses harmful spending cuts\" —@PressSec on today's short-term funding vote pic.twitter.com/SUUcKqIoGs\r\n— The White House (@WhiteHouse) September 30, 2015\n\nThe legislation finances the government through Dec. 11, providing 10 weeks to negotiate a more wide-ranging budget deal that would carry past the 2016 presidential election. But the talks promise to be difficult, and success is not assured.\n\nBoehner is resigning from Congress at the end of October, a decision he announced last week after informing Republicans he would not risk a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood.\n\nSee also: Speaker John Boehner to resign in October\n\nA similar fight over implementing Obama's health care law sparked a 16-day shutdown two years ago that Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and other top Republicans did not want to repeat in election season. McConnell is seeking to protect embattled incumbents in Democratic-leaning states such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, while some GOP conservatives are more apt to use the battle to appeal to the party's core voters on the right.\n\n\"Today was a win for the Washington cartel, and another setback for the American people,\" said Rep. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who is using combat with Washington GOP leaders to help define his presidential campaign. \"Republican leadership chose to abandon its constitutional power of the purse and to fund 100 percent of President Obama's failed agenda.\"\n\nSupport from Democrats also helped power the measure through the Senate, all of the opposition coming from conservative Republicans.\n\nLongtime lawmakers bemoaned the chronic dysfunction on Capitol Hill and the collapse of the annual appropriations process that is supposed to be wrapped up by now. Democrats demanding a new budget deal have blocked work in the Senate, while a fight over the Confederate flag halted work in the House with only six of the 12 annual spending bills having passed.\n\n\"It is to my great dismay that we are at this point again, requiring a temporary Band-Aid to buy us time to do our duty,\" said Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., chairman of the Appropriations Committee, during House debate.\n\nTea party anger directed at Boehner over the Planned Parenthood issue helped prod the Ohio Republican's announcement to step down. His decision — and other House leadership races — have highlighted divisions between more pragmatic Republicans and hardline conservative wing that is increasingly prominent in Congress, especially in the rough-and-tumble House.\n\nMcConnell said Tuesday that he and Boehner spoke with Obama recently and that he expects budget negotiations to get underway soon. The turmoil in the House, where many conservatives want to block spending increases, is certain to complicate the talks, which are likely to focus on swapping near-term budget increases for the Pentagon and domestic programs for longer-term saving elsewhere in the budget.\n\nMajority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the likely new House speaker, hasn't said whether he supports a deal.\n\nSee also: Congress proves it's now impossible to talk sanely about abortion\n\nThe Pentagon and domestic agencies all are still operating under automatic curbs that would effectively freeze their spending at current levels. Republicans are leading the drive to boost defense while Obama is demanding equal relief for domestic programs.\n\nThe conversation among McConnell, Boehner and Obama took place in mid-September — before Boehner announced he was stepping down. Many of the conservative GOP lawmakers who helped bring Boehner down want to preserve stringent \"caps\" on the spending bills Congress passes every year. But Senate Republicans are generally more eager to rework the 2011 Budget Control Act that put them in place.\n\nI'm proud Dems fought to protect women’s access to health care. Today we passed a bill to prevent a shutdown and fund Planned Parenthood.\n\n— Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) September 30, 2015\n\n\"We have to stop devastating sequester cuts from hitting our military and middle class, even the Republican leader agrees,\" said top Senate Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada. \"Because a week or 10 days ago he said 'We are inevitably going to end up in negotiations that that will crack the Budget Control Act once again. I say 'hallelujah.'\"\n\nEight of the 20 Republican senators who opposed Wednesday's bill are up for re-election in states carried by Mitt Romney in 2012. Presidential aspirants Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida skipped the vote.\n\nRepublicans have long targeted Planned Parenthood, and the group's top official defended it in congressional testimony on Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans say that videos made by abortion foes show Planned Parenthood has broken federal laws including a ban on for-profit fetal tissue sales. The organization says it has acted legally and the videos were deceptively edited.\n\nAdditional reporting by Mashable.\n\nHave something to add to this story? Share it in the comments."

        "plain": "Your rowdiest, most debauched night has nothing on Joseph Gillespie. \n\nGillespie, you see, was accused of stealing a minor-league baseball team's mascot costume, fleeing the scene while wearing said costume, then continuing to party the night away while dressed as a dragon. \n\nThat all happened two weekends ago. But this Wednesday, the world finally learned Gillespie's side of the story. \n\nEpic does not begin to describe it. \n\nSee also: The baffling mystery of the Toronto Blue Jays' ripped-out urinal flood\n\nInitial news reports out of Charlotte earlier this month all read pretty much the same. Guy steals the Charlotte Knights' \"Homer the Dragon\" mascot costume from BB&T Ballpark. Guy runs away. Guy is later arrested at his home. (Guy also sports righteous mullet, as shown below.)\n\nPolice: Man breaks into BB&T Ballpark, steals @KnightsBaseball costume, runs away wearing it. http://t.co/8s9553kAGb pic.twitter.com/LD6gpYzz6T— Bill Melugin (@BillFOX46) September 21, 2015\n\nBefore we continue, behold this full-body shot of Homer to keep in mind as you continue reading:\n\nThen, this Wednesday, the Charlotte alt-weekly Creative Loafing caught up with Gillespie. The full interview is a real doozy, and we recommend checking it out here. But meanwhile, here are a few choice quotes from Joseph Gillespie, a modern-day hero if ever there was one. \n\nOn how he encountered the costume after attending the Charlotte Beerfest at BB&T Ballpark:\n\nThe event ended at 9 p.m., but the next thing I remember I wake up at about 12:30 a.m. on Sunday and I'm at the bottom of a stairwell with no idea where I am. I called Mark, and he said, \"Where the fuck are you?\" I said, \"Dude, I don't know. I think I'm still in the stadium.\"\n\nHe said he was at Hooters, so I told him to stay there. I start walking down the hallway to leave and I look to my right and see the mascot dressing room. I thought, there's no way this door is unlocked. I turned the handle and it opens right up and there's the damned costume.\n\nSo, I suited right up, walked out the door and proceeded to Hooters. I walked right up into Hooters and my buddy didn't even know it was me. I was ragin' dude.\n\nOn how his costumed night proceeded after Hooters:\n\nI left Hooters and there was a big line at Tilt next door. I just said, \"Yo man, can I go in?\" The guy said, \"No,\" and I was like, \"Dude, You're not gonna let Homer the fuckin' mascot into your bar right now?\" Then he said I could go in. There was nobody on the dance floor. I come sliding in and start getting it. I was doing all the moves you always wanted to try but are too embarrassed to.\n\nOn Homer's effect on the ladies:\n\nI got like three numbers that night and have added like 20 chicks on Facebook. That's been a plus.\n\nOn why police found him at home also in possession of a two-way radio from the mascot dressing room:\n\nI got that in case they radioed that the suit was stolen so I could just chime them back and say, \"Hey, I have it. Don't worry, I'll return it.\"\n\nNow seriously, go read the whole interview. It'll be the best thing you do all day. \n\nBONUS: 25 of YouTube's Funniest Sports Fails"

We will love you forever Leland.\"\n\n\"Still with you,\" the note reads, as well as a thank you to his mother and father, followed by a wish that they have a good day. \n\nIn an email to Mashable Amber says that she and her husband \"cried together for the longest time,\" after discovering the note.  \"We will cherish it forever and plan to frame it along with the last pictures that he drew me when he was in the hospital.\"\n\nAmber says that she \"never imagined that his note would touch so many people,\" and is overwhelmed by the support that her family has received from people around the world.\n\nSome media outlets reported that the note read \"goodbye,\" but Amber later clarified that the message read \"good day.\" She also used this as an opportunity to thank everyone for the outpouring of support from the community. \n\n(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3\";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));I just wanted to clarify that the letter from Leland doesn't say goodbye.

        "plain": "It's time to stop panicking about Apple's Wi-Fi assist feature in iOS 9.\n\nIf you've been blowing through data since upgrading to iOS 9 or buying a new iPhone, it's probably not because of Wi-Fi Assist; it's because of your bad settings.\n\nSee also: The 15 best features of iOS 9, in GIFs\n\nWi-Fi assist is a new feature Apple introduced in iOS 9. Enabled by default, the feature helps ensure you are always using the best connection possible. So if your Wi-Fi signal becomes weak or unreliable, the setting will automatically switch you over to your cellular connection.\n\niOS 9, and Wi-Fi assist, have only been out for two weeks but many have already been quick to sound the alarm bells that this setting will chew through your data and cause those dreaded overages. But this \"issue\" is massively overblown. Yes, it's true WI-Fi Assist will prioritize your data connection over Wi-Fi in some situations. But the reality is it's extremely unlikely that this setting is what's causing you to blow through your data cap. \n\nIf you're going over your data limit, it's more likely because of bad settings -- not WiFI-Assist. In the almost three months I've been using iOS 9, I have never seen it kick on -- even when I was on an overloaded network and wished that it would. Unless you live or work somewhere that has a really poor Wi-Fi signal, then it's safe to leave it on. If you insist on turning it off, you can by heading to Settings --> Cellular and scrolling all the way to the bottom.\n\nBut for most people, it's a useful feature to keep on and there are a few settings you can tweak that will allow you to take advantage of Wi-Fi assist without data anxiety. You can start by restricting which apps are able to use cellular data. If you have a limited amount of data there are some apps, like Netflix, you should really never use over a cellular connection. You can easily manage which apps are able to use data from your settings. \n\nHead to Settings --> Cellular and scroll down to the list of apps. Go ahead and turn off anything you don't regularly use, as well as any especially data-hungry apps like those that stream music and video.\n\nKeep in mind that there are some apps, like maps and email, that you're more likely to use while on the move so you should leave those enabled. You can keep tabs on your data usage from the cellular menu in the Settings app by using the \"reset statistics\" option all the way at the bottom underneath Wi-Fi Assist. If your especially paranoid about your data use, check with your carrier to see when your billing cycle resets each month and set a reminder to reset your statistics on that day as well.\n\nFurthermore, many apps use background refresh, which allows them to use data even when you aren't using them, which can also eat into your monthly allotment. While it's useful to keep it on for apps you frequently use, you can preserve resources (including your battery life) by turning it off for apps you use less frequently.\n\nTo do this, open your Settings and scroll down to the list of apps. Select the ones you want to disable background refresh on and the option appears, along with the option to turn off cellular data.\n\nHave something to add to this story? Share it in the comments."

        "plain": "The \"Rolls Royce\" option of the National Broadband Network (NBN), a A$500 million, 6,400-kilogram satellite, has been launched into space from South America.\n\nCarrying much of the hopes of the NBN on its expensive shoulders, Sky Muster was launched on a rocket at about 6.30 a.m. AEST Thursday, as the Australian Financial Review reports. The satellite is designed to provide broadband access to over 200,000 rural or remote Australians at a speed of 25 megabits per second, according to new Communications Minister Mitch Fifield.\n\nSEE ALSO: What now for the NBN under a Turnbull government?\n\nThe satellite successfully detached from the rocket about half an hour later and is now preparing to deploy solar panels. If all goes well with a series of tests, it will be connected to the NBN in the second half of next year. A second satellite will also be launched early next year, while 10 ground stations will be needed for support. NBN Chairman Ziggy Switkowski described the launch as \"loud, explosive and muscular.\"\n\n\"It is a historic day,\" Switkowski told the outlet. Sky Muster is a very controversial aspect of the much-maligned NBN project. It was originally a Labor policy, with now-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull describing it as a pricy \"Rolls Royce\" option while in opposition.\n\nShadow Communications Minister Jason Clare has pointed out with glee that this was all Labor's idea. \"Fortunately for rural and regional Australians, Labor signed the contracts for delivery of these satellites before the last election,\" Clare told the ABC. \"In a backflip worthy of Nadia Comaneci, Malcolm Turnbull now calls these satellites 'game changers'.\n\n\"As they say -- better late than never.\"\n\nThe satellites are still a very controversial subject though, with concerns that it's too risky and that they won't actually provide adequate Internet to rural areas. \n\nWant to grow your business with Instagram?

        "plain": "A few hours before Elon Musk took the stage and unveiled the Model X to the world, Tesla had invited a small group of journalists out to its Fremont, California headquarters to not only study the car up-close but also drive it.\n\nGiven fewer than 10 minutes of one-on-one time with the car, there wasn't a lot of time to snap detailed pictures, make a video and drive the car around the prescribed loop laid out on the back parking lots of the company's HQ.\n\nSee also: Tesla Model X revealed: 250-mile range, Falcon Wing doors, Ludicrous mode\n\nFaced with a choice between the three, I jumped behind the wheel and gingerly took the course. Before I took off, however, Jeffrey Brian \"JB\" Straubel, Tesla's chief technical officer jumped into the passenger seat. Watching the images depicted by radar parking sensors on the 17-inch touchscreen at my right knee, I carefully backed out of the tent in which the Model X was parked and made my way onto the circuit.\n\nEerily quiet\n\nCruising at an eerily quiet 25 mph, the first thing that struck me about piloting the all-electric SUV was its Panoramic Windshield. Even while sitting further back (I'm 6-foot-5-inches tall), the windshield still stretched over my head. \n\nIt may seem like a headline-grabbing feature since it is unusual, but the Panoramic Windshield visually invites front passengers into the scenery and road ahead. Although I had the steering wheel firmly in both hands, looking out through the massive piece of glass--the largest ever fitted to a production vehicle-- I felt like I was floating down the road.\n\nNeck-wrenching\n\nBreaking my momentary serenity, Straubel told me to hammer the throttle, as we were riding in the $142,000 P90D (Performance 90-kilowatt-hour dual-motor) Founder model with Ludicrous mode engaged. Forgetting the immediacy and severity of all-electric torque, I punched the throttle, unleashing all 259 horsepower in the front and 503 horsepower in the rear, and quite literally wrenched my own head backward. I giggled a moment, as I reached back to grasp my mildly injured neck.\n\nAfter going full throttle a few more times and briefly enjoying watching the world melt passed my periphery in the Panoramic Windshield, I turned onto the slalom course. Slowly pushing into the accelerator once again, I hurdled the Model X through several S-corners.\n\nTo my amazement, I found the car incredibly planted while also remaining supple, in terms of ride quality. In addition to the competent air suspension, the stability comes from the front and rear motors ability to independently apply positive and negative torque. While the SUV body stays planted, so does the driver's. The well-cushioned seats kept me in place without making me feel as if I were being wedged into a small sarcophagus, as is the unfortunate feeling of tight sport seats.\n\n17 speakers\n\nLeaving the slalom, I turned back onto the straightaway. Instead of flooring the accelerator again, Straubel suggested I turn up the Model X's 17-speaker sound system. Tesla's press packet describes the precisely-placed speakers as being able to create a concert hall inside the cabin. Often this sort of description is akin to shameless embellishment. In the case of the Model X, however, it's pretty spot on.\n\nThere was little road and powertrain noise to compete with and the speakers didn't have much to contend with in the cavernous and well-constructed cabin either. The result is a sound experience that immerses the occupants rather than abrades them.\n\nFalcon Wing doors\n\nPulling into a parking lot Tesla set up to demonstrate the flexibility of the Falcon Wing Doors, I slowly guided the Model X between a minivan and a full-size SUV. Leaving only a few inches beyond the sideview mirrors on either side, I commanded the car to open the rear doors with the push of a button on the center touchscreen.\n\nRequiring only 30 centimeters of space to open, the doors feature ultrasonic sensors embedded behind the sheetmetal -- the first of their kind capable of seeing through metal -- that avoid obstacles and alter the opening operation. The doors perfectly sensed the cars on either side and opened accordingly. When I was ready to go, I hit the button on the touchscreen and they came to a graceful close.\n\nFirst impression\n\nAlthough I only had a few minutes behind the wheel of the Tesla Model X, I can say I am wholly impressed. A lot of the concerns I had with the Model S, notably its lackluster interior, have been addressed in the Model X. As Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk pointed out, the upstart EV automaker could have simply made a taller, bigger Model S and enjoyed similar adulation from the public.\n\nInstead, they shot for the proverbial moon, over-engineering virtually everything. And that care and precision is palpable from behind the wheel of the car. \n\nAmusingly, a lot of what makes the Model X special are features that bean counters at more established automakers would have nixed in the early stages. That's what makes Tesla so distinctive in the industry: They dare to dream. And in turn, the cars it creates delight the rest of us. \n\n Have something to add to this story?

        "plain": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA -- Google -- or as co-founder Sergey Brin put it, \"Google, ah, sorry, I mean Alphabet\" -- held a thoroughly fascinating event for a small gathering of press here at the Googleplex Tuesday. Brin and his team showed off the latest data from the company's formerly secretive self-driving car project. We got to take rides in two self-driving prototypes: the familiar small box above and a beautiful Lexus model. \n\nEverything we saw told us the Google car is astonishingly advanced, alert to all possible dangers with an insanely detailed awareness of its surroundings, and way better than you pathetic humans at driving in general. It will free up whole new vistas of time in your life, give you more energy when you get home, and give your elderly and disabled friends a whole new lease on mobility. \n\nJust one problem: Nobody at Google could tell us when we can get our hands on one, or how much it will cost, or even who is going to make it. They dodged repeated questions on the topic. \"I hope we can tell you more in a few years' time,\" Brin said, before casually exiting the event in his own personal driverless car. \n\nSee also: Get out of the driver's seat, human\n\nThis made the event fairly unusual in the annals of Silicon Valley for a company this size. Imagine Tim Cook unveiling the iPhone 6S to the world's media, then shrugging when asked when we could get one. Elon Musk might have had slightly less interest in the Tesla Model X launch Tuesday if he'd announced his Gigafactory wasn't making any of the cars, it just seemed like a neat idea to show it off. (Actually, that sounds like something the parody account Bored Elon Musk might say.) \n\nThe presentation on driverless cars was extremely effective at pumping the buying temperature, as salespeople say. In video after video, we saw just how effective the car was at understanding everything going on around it, four or five car lengths in every direction. We saw how the car's triple-threat combination of cameras, radar and lasers builds up a far more detailed real-time map of the road than any pair of human eyes could manage. We saw how it can detect a cyclist's hand signals, a police siren, construction cones, the stop sign on the back of a school bus. \n\nA cyclist shot a red light at a four-way intersection; the Google car was the only one that correctly guessed its trajectory and stayed put at the light rather than moving off and swerving. A child ran out unexpectedly around a blind corner; the car stopped before it even got to the corner. A woman in an electric wheelchair randomly chased a turkey around the road with a broom; the car didn't know what the heck was happening, but stopped anyway. \n\nThe Google team says it has assembled the auto equivalent of white-hat hackers to try to figure out how to confuse the car. They've tried jumping out of sidewalk Porta-Potties into the road; they've tried jumping out of the back of flatbed trucks. Nothing fazes this machine. \n\nIts brethren have driven a combined 1.2 million miles autonomously and are adding up to 15,000 extra miles of experience every week, all of which goes into each car's memory to help it figure out further confusing situations; the company just rolled out more testing in Austin. The car has has redundant backup brakes and a redundant backup computer. In the Lexus model, the driver can take back control of a regular steering wheel at the push of a button. (The Google-made model only has four buttons: stop, go, windows, temperature.) \n\nAs Google pointed out, there are some 30,000 deaths on the road in the U.S. alone every year, the equivalent crashing a hundred 747 jets annually. \n\nSo if this can make us significantly safer, why isn't this anywhere near being a product yet? \n\nReporters were left scratching their heads. Was the company trying to whet our appetites for an announcement in 2017? Could this press-boosting event be part of a strategy in the ongoing negotiations between Google (sorry, Alphabet) and potential partners in the car industry? Or does Brin just think that a whole lot of reeducation is necessary before the mundane world will accept what his labs have to offer?\n\nPersonally, I'm leaning towards the latter. The Google X division that Brin runs has been burned by the public response to Google Glass. It seemed to them a perfectly reasonable piece of technology that would reduce our dangerous dependence on smartphones; the world saw the weirdos chosen as \"Google Glass explorers\" and denounced them as glassholes. \n\nIt wouldn't be at all surprising if Google X was excessively cautious about its next product roll-out. Indeed, Brin got a taste of the potential angry pushback at the event, from an Australian reporter who waxed lyrical about the generations of men in his family and their connections to their cars. How dare Google take this away from them? \n\nBrin fielded that one calmly. \"I definitely empathize,\" he said. \"In America, people have intimate relationships with cars, too. I love the feeling of being out on the open road, but that's 1% of my experience. Mostly it's stop-and-go traffic, or hunting for parking ... there's a future for both of these worlds. But for a large percentage of day-to-day driving, people are going to prefer this.\"\n\n    Insert Yakkety Sax here #Google #selfdrivingcar #hyperlapse A video posted by Chris Taylor (@futurechris) on Sep 29, 2015 at 12:26pm PDT\r\n \n\nIn general, worrying about a glasshole-like reaction to the driverless car is like fighting the next war on the basis of the last one. Stick Google Glass on someone's face and they're still going to be a little weirded out. Stick them in a driverless car and they get it almost immediately, right around the time the car actually stops all the way at a stop sign or slows down when there are tiny pedestrians at play in a residential neighborhood. \n\nThe company is full of anecdotes about driverless car testers whose lives were changed by the vehicle. One woman suddenly started running in the evenings and cooking for her family with all the energy she had left over from not fighting traffic for two hours every day. A blind man was brought to tears by his newfound ability to pick up dry cleaning and hit the drive-thru at Taco Bell. \n\nOne woman on the team talked about how thrilled a neighbor of hers was that the cars were driving through her area -- because, she said, it made all the other cars on the road behind it slow down and actually obey the speed limit. Ask any parent who has lost a child to an auto accident how much we need this. \n\nOnce you understand the technology and its inherent safety, the driverless car practically sells itself. Some caution is warranted, of course. But if Google takes it slow and cautious, that's no help at all to the 30,000 people who are going to be killed this year by humans behind the wheel. \n\n Have something to add to this story?

        "plain": "One person's trash can be another's treasure -- or, in this case, someone else's party bus. \n\nDonald Trump's abandoned 40-foot blue campaign coach, emblazoned with \"TRUMP\" along with his slogan, \"Make America Great,\" can now be yours for $15,000. \n\nSee also: Carve your own Donald Trumpkin in time for Halloween\n\nSteve Drake, the bus's owner, told the Des Moines Register that the Trump campaign had used it for months, but recently abandoned it due to a shift in strategy. Drake, who owns and rents out five party buses, says he is a Trump supporter and was approached by Tana Goertz, the former Apprentice contestant who works for the Trump campaign in Iowa.\n\nThough Drake typically charges about $100 an hour to rent out a bus, the campaign worked out a longer term deal with him, and paid to customize their own bus. \n\n“The campaign originally was out with it every day of the month, out seeing people, soliciting for Donald,” he told the  Register. “What I’ve been told from them is that basically [they've] switched and they’re going to be dedicated to being on the phones for this next 30 to 60 days trying to help with [the causes].”\n\nThe bus was originally listed on Craigslist, but the post was taken down. \"It was ruffling some feathers,\" Mark Gearhart, the bus's mechanic told the Register. \n\nThough he didn't specify whose feathers were ruffled, he said, “I’m sure you can use your imagination and think about who.” He did, however, confirm that the bus is still for sale. \n\nPrior to being abandoned, it traveled back and forth through the state -- Drake estimates that it's gone through more than half of Iowa's 99 counties. \n\nThe price may seem a bit steep for a 1998 model that has seen two transmissions, but Gearhart has complete faith in the coach.\n\n“It’s an old bus but it’ll get you there,” he said.\n\nIn any case, Drake is deftly timing the sale of the bus with Trump's political popularity. \n\n“I figured if I could sell it while it’s hot, while Donald’s hot, I would try to do that. If not, I’ll just keep it and use it.”\n\nHave something to add to this story? Share it in the comments."
