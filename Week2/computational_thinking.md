# Computational Thinking

> In class example problems

## 1. Looking things up

Your address book/contacts app stores every contact that you have on your phone in alphabetical order by first name. Each record contains a `name`, `cell_phone`, and `home_phone` record. You need to call your friend Drew on his *cell phone* but don't remember his phone number. Using computational thinking, what are the steps to look up Drew's information and pull out his cell phone number? Use psuedo code to describe your answer.

## 2. Counting things

You've been given a list of the names of politicians and celebrities. You need to count how many celebrities are in the list while skipping over politicians. Using computational thinking, list the steps needed to iterate over each item in the list and increment a counter when the current name on the list is a celebrity.

Assumptions and tips:

- Let's assume there's a function called `is_celebrity?` that will return `true` or `false` based on whether the name you give it is that of a celebrity
- The list of names are: `['Kim Kardashian', 'Hulk Hogan', 'Kermit the Frog', 'Donald Trump', 'Matt Lauer', 'Barack Obama', 'Hillary Clinton']`

## 3. Sorting Things

You have a list of names. Some of these are male and some are female. From the master list, create 2 new lists. One list will contain only the male names and the second list will contain only female names. Describe the steps involved using computational thinking and write out your answer in psuedo code.

Assumptions and tips:

- Assume there's a function called `is_female_name?` that will return `true` when the name you give it is female and `false` when the name you pass it belongs to a male.
- The list of names are `['Kim Kardashian', 'Hulk Hogan', 'Kermit the Frog', 'Donald Trump', 'Matt Lauer', 'Barack Obama', 'Hillary Clinton']`
