## Homework

*For all homework this week, the easiest way to set it up is to copy the contents of the `assignments` folder into a new folder named after yourself. You can use this command to set it up:

```
cp -R Week3/Lesson1/Homework/assignments Week3/Lesson1/Homework/your_name
```

That command will copy the contents of `assignments` to a new folder named after yourself. From there you can work on the files in your folder so the example assignments can stay intact for everyone else.

__Apartment Objects Lab__

Create a version of the Apartment example using classes and objects. In the `Homework/assignments` folder, the `ex_apartment_objects` folder contains the code the complete the assignment. __*DO NOT TOUCH OR MODIFY THE `main.rb` FILE AT ALL*__. Your job is to build out the classes in the `lib` folder so that `main.rb` will run without errors.

HINT: I've completed the assignment so you can see what the answers are by looking at the assignment itself starting on Oct. 7th.

__Due date:__ Oct. 13th

__Secret Number Objects__

This is the same idea as the Apartment assignment except this time I'm not giving you guys the answer until next class.
